# What does it do?

'Windows Liquifier' is another name for Matt's Custom Recovery and Utilities using DISM (C.R.U.D.) for Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE).
Basically, the Windows Liquifier is a series of Windows batch script files, run on the start of Windows PE.

The Windows Liquifier can wipe local hard drives, install Windows 10 Home and Pro, and (probably the coolest) can create a local administrator for almost any Windows installation.
