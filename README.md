## What does it do?

'Windows Liquifier' is another name for Matt's Custom Recovery and Utilities using DISM (C.R.U.D.) for Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE).
Basically, the Windows Liquifier is a series of Windows batch script files, run on the start of Windows PE.

The Windows Liquifier can wipe local hard drives, install Windows 10 Home and Pro, and (probably the coolest) can create a local administrator for almost any Windows installation.
All of these processes are linked together by a main menu of sorts, which is a batch script that runs on the start of Windows PE.

## Bugs/Issues

At the moment of v0.1 release, the detectbios.bat file does not work as intended. There may be some minor bugs, so feel free to submit a bug report.

## Installation

The Windows Liquifier is intended to be downloaded as an .iso file, so the user can easily burn the image onto a USB flash drive (recommended), a DVD (maybe), or onto a hard drive (unlikely).
